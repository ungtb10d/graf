The graf package is a java/osgi layout package using grafviz as a rendering engine.
The package contains an abstraction of graf, Vertex and Edge and has a graf Cascading Style Sheet (GCSS)
implementation that makes it easy to separate graf structure from styling information.

The package requires grafviz to be installed on the host where the package is running in order to
produce PNG, JPG, SVG, (and more formats) output, but can be used to produce .dot output without grafviz
binary being present. 

Configuration is done using google guice.
